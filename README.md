# TrackOrder
# Order Management System

## Overview

The Order Management System is a web application that allows users to submit, edit, and delete orders for various food items. The application categorizes orders into three types: Desi, Chinese, and Italiano. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing orders and utilizes a RESTful API for data storage.

## Features

- **Add Orders**: Users can submit new orders by providing the item name, price, and type of cuisine.
- **Edit Orders**: Users can edit existing orders, including changing the item details and the type of cuisine. The order will automatically move to the appropriate category list based on the selected type.
- **Delete Orders**: Users can delete orders from the list, which will also remove them from the backend storage.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Persistence**: Orders are stored using a RESTful API, ensuring that data persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Local Storage**: The application utilizes local storage to temporarily store order details for quick access.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, using Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side logic and interaction.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the RESTful API.
- **RESTful API**: CRUD operations are performed using the [CrudCrud](https://crudcrud.com/) API for data storage.
